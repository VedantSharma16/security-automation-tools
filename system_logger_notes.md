In todays project, I made a system logger that runs like Windows defender. I created a list (a small one) with some keywords that might be a red flag if found running. This program runs through the system, gives a log file with all the running processes and finds if any words from the red-flag words list is present or not. If it is, the user is informed. 
![[system_logger.py]]
Now lets breakdown the code:
1. Imports: As evident from the code , I have used various imports, some of them I don't know about, but now I have an idea thanks to chatGPT. So the first is the `os` that lets python interact with our system. Then we have `platform` that tells us the system details like Windows, Linux or any other, along with the version number etc. The next is `socket` which well I knew about since yesterday's tool. Fourth one is `getpass` that helps us to grab the current logged in username securely. It takes away the headache from user to enter their username or other things. `datetime` is a pretty common library used to extract the current date and time. The last one `subprocess` is the most important library here as it tells us the 'task list' or the programs running on the computer so that it can be written on our log file. 
2. The next thing is creating our filename, where I've used the imported `datetime` library to name our file as per the current date and time. I know it's a bit inefficient as it creates a new file every time you run the program, but its easier to keep record of the time if any malicious activity is found. I'd see if I want to update it to overwrite the logs or not. `.strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')` formats the date time string so its more readable.
3. In the next code snippet, we use the file handling of python to fill the log file with all the processes running and information of the system. Most of the imported libraries like `socket` & `getpass` are used here to extract the information. Here is a list of each command thanks to ChatGPT: 
	- `"=== Basic System Information ===\n"` — just a header to organize your log.
	- `getpass.getuser()` — gets the **current username** logged into the machine.
	- `socket.gethostname()` — gets the **computer’s hostname** (like a name for your PC on the network)
	- `socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())` — gets the **IP address** of your PC by looking up the hostname.
	- `platform.system()` — tells you the OS name (like Windows, Linux, or Darwin for macOS).
	- `platform.release()` — gives the OS version/release number.
	- `os.getcwd()` — shows your **current working directory**, like where you’re running this script from.
4. In the next step we use our last imported library `subprocess` to print all the running subprocesses on our machine. First I wrote a message indicating that below are the "Running Processes" and then `try` command to try run the subprocess command on windows. This in turn runs the `tasklist` commands on windows and gives the output to us using `.decode()`. Then the `except` command is for Linux and macOS users as it runs the command for those operating systems. After its done, the processes are written into the log file. 
5. The last part of the code is regarding how the code runs through our "sus words" text file and search for any suspicious words if found in any program running on the computer. I have used a `.lower()` command to match it with the text file words. Then I have used a basic `if else` statement to tell the user if there is a suspicious word or not. In the end, the file is saved and user is informed via `print` command.
